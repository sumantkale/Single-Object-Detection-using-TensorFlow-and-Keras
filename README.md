## Overview

This project focuses on single object detection using TensorFlow and Keras. We utilize a lightweight dataset for training and aim to solve the single object detection problem with minimal setup.

## Notebook Contents

The Jupyter Notebook covers the following topics:

1. **Data Analysis:** Exploring and understanding the dataset.
2. **Data Loading:** Efficiently loading and preprocessing the data.
3. **Model Setup:** Creating and configuring the object detection model.
4. **Training:** Training the model for object detection.
5. **Visualization:** Visualizing the results and model performance.

## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you'll need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- BeautifulSoup (for data preprocessing)

You can install these packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy seaborn matplotlib beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage

1. **Data Preparation:**

   - Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate directory.

   ```python
   local_zip = 'datasets.zip'
   zip_ref = zipfile.ZipFile(local_zip, 'r')
   zip_ref.extractall('datasets')
   zip_ref.close()
   ```

2. **Data Preprocessing:**

   - Process the dataset to make it suitable for training.

3. **Training:**

   - Train the object detection model by running the provided notebook.

4. **Visualization:**

   - Visualize the model's performance and detection results using the provided code.

## Model Architecture

The model architecture is designed for bounding box regression with an input size of 224x224 and an output of 4 channels (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax). It consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by dense layers for regression.

## Results

After training the model, you can visualize the detection results and assess the model's performance. Feel free to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters and train it for more epochs to achieve better accuracy.
